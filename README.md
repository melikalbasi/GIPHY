# GIPHY

In this project, I utilized the GIPHY API to create a website where you can search for gifs of all your favorite characters, whether its be television shows, movies or books. My site displays an example of characters from the TV show Friends, but you can search any popular characters you like, and buttons will populate and you can click them and enjoy the animated graphics GIPHY provides! You can click each gif to activate their animated awesomeness. Friends fans: try searching 'Janice'.
